                    While students at SSN immerse themselves in academics, the college has a lot in store for them outside the classroom. Student life includes participation in sports, recreational, co-curricular and cultural activities. In short, at SSN, students will find an academic and social environment where everyone- from faculty members to peers helps shape their future.
                 
                    SSN is a home to aesthetically-designed buildings with state of the-art computer and internet facilities, modern workshops, seminar halls, auditoriums and well-stocked libraries, sports and games fields in addition to an indoor stadium with gymnasium.

                    As an exemplary institution of learning, SSN follows an admission policy that strongly favours merit, even as it enables access to education for students from all strata of society through appropriate scholarships. The Institution boasts of a strong alumni network with alumni events held every year serving as a platform for past students to give back to SSN and share their experiences with its present fellow students.
                 
                    With so much to offer, it is only natural that students of SSN get a unique opportunity to carve a niche for themselves in their preferred field of study that would enable them to become well-rounded and discerning citizens, fully qualified for their chosen professions in the workplace.</p>
